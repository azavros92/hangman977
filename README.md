# Hangman

Hangman is a classic game where a player tries to guess a hidden word one letter at a time. This project is a Python implementation where the computer randomly selects the word, and the user has to guess it before running out of lives.

## Description

This is a Python-based Hangman game developed as part of a learning project. The user guesses letters to uncover a randomly selected word. The game provides feedback for correct and incorrect guesses and tracks the number of lives remaining.

The project is broken down into milestones:
- `milestone_2.py`: Basic game logic.
- `milestone_3.py`: Refactored with functions.
- `milestone_4.py`: Refactored using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
- `milestone_5.py`: Full game wrapped in a play_game() function.

## What I Learned

- Using Python's `random` module to select words.
- Handling user input with validation.
- Writing and calling functions.
- Implementing object-oriented programming with classes and methods.
- Structuring code for clarity and maintainability.
- Using Git and GitHub to track versions and updates.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/azavros92/hangman977.git



## Usage
	1.	Run the final version of the game:
		python milestone_5.py
	2.	Follow the on-screen prompts:
		•	The program will randomly choose a word.
		•	You will be prompted to guess a letter.
		•	You will receive feedback on whether your guess was correct.
		•	The game continues until you guess the word or run out of lives.
